                <p>Oh! Hello there. How is this journey of yours with robotics going? Awesome? Good! Shall we proceed? Ok! But before proceeding, if I ask you how a digital watch calculates time so precisely every time. If you try to count up to a minute, it all gets messed up sometimes. </p>

Who is that genius saint sitting at the center, doing all the work, and how on earth can a phone recognize a fingerprint within a sec! Isn‚Äôt it impossible for a human being to figure out a fingerprint with a touch unless he is a superhuman or terminator? </p>

                <p>We‚Äôll first introduce the ICs and then we‚Äôll dive deep into what types of ICs we have, how they are classified, how an IC looks, and pretty much everything necessary for you to know.</p>
                <p>Then we shall continue with the processing unit in which you‚Äôll get along with microcontrollers and the genius saints sitting inside the core of computers.  </p>
                <p>And then, we‚Äôll descend into the sensors, their types, classification, etc.</p>
                <p>So, starting with ICs. Any idea where to find them?</p>
                <p>In your phone? Yes!</p>
                <p>In cameras? S√≠!</p>

                <p>For a layman, those little black chips you see in most of the circuit boards are ICs...but let‚Äôs dive a little deeper.</p>

                <p>This is what ICs looks like. </p>
                <p>So, ICs or Integrated Circuits are the building blocks of most electronic devices. They are the basis of modern electronics, hearts, and brains of most of the electronic circuits. Without ICs most of electronic devices are meaningless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
                <p>You have studied circuits <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KM9s8IOHqSPjekVtNrmfPuPmwZfLFuL4CkbSk_w8uOE/edit">here</a>  Let‚Äôs move one step forward and know the types of circuits first in which you‚Äôll understand clearly about ICs:</p>

                <h1>Discrete circuit  </h1>
                <p>It is a circuit built using components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc. that are fabricated separately and are connected using conducting wires on a circuit board or a <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://www.elprocus.com/different-types-printed-circuit-boards/"> printed circuit board</a> , or a <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5pxSWxeyuE371x4Ok4W4LLnEHO-bS6YzTHthfKYBME/edit#bookmark=id.3uo9xlnh2ohz">breadboard</a>.</p>
                <div className="my-8 text-center">
                    <Image src={Circuit} />
                </div>
                <p className="my-8 text-center">A simple discrete circuit we created earlier</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>So, we see we have a working circuit from discrete components, right? Then why are integrated circuits needed in the first place? Can you think of some reasons for yourself? If you figured it out, you might want to write it somewhere. We will discuss them after the integrated circuits. So, let us see what an integrated circuit is.</p>
                <h1>Integrated Circuits</h1>
                <p>In simple words, an IC is a collection of several tiny electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.), all stuffed on a semiconductor wafer and connected to achieve a common goal (e.g. we have an IC for the regulation of voltage. Several tiny electronic components are fabricated inside the IC to achieve a common goal of regulation of voltage). But the surprising part is that the components in an IC are microscopic and range in millions. What these small things can do is pretty astonishing too. </p>

                <p>They can function as</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Logic Gates (74xx series) - an electronic circuit that relates input and output via certain logic.</li>
                    <li>Timer (IC 555) - helps in calculating the time</li>
                    <li>Voltage Regulator (IC 7805) -  helps maintain the voltage of a power source within acceptable limits</li>
                    <div className="my-8 text-center">
                        <Image src={Superhero} />
                    </div>
                    <li>Motors Driver (IC L293D, L298N) - amplifies the input voltage and current to drive motors and much more, we‚Äôll talk in detail later</li>
                    <li>Microcontrollers(ATmega328)*</li>
                    <li>Microprocessors(Intel 8085)*</li>
                </ul>

                <p>*will talk about these later</p>

                <p>We discussed discrete circuits and integrated circuits but why are integrated circuits required if we already have discrete circuits?</p>
                <p>So here is a difference table between discrete and integrated circuits -</p>

                <h1>Importance of ICs in Robotics</h1>
                <p>We now know what ICs are but why are ICs important in robotics? Because ICs interact with electric current to achieve different tasks despite their small size that is all we need to handle electronic data in robotics and other electronic devices. Some ICs are used for basic decision-making in robots and some are used in circuits for voltage regulation, amplification, etc. Some of them are used for calculating time (which we‚Äôll study in detail in 555 timer IC later) while some are used for handling heavy processing tasks for robots.</p>
                <p>ICs not only revolutionized the field of robotics but also innovated electronics to great extent.</p>
